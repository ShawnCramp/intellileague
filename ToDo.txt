ToDo List for intellileague iPhone Project

I created a developer account on the Riot API
Our API Key is: 2472734e-3298-44d5-b026-b21e290f7959

We use it like this:

https://na.api.pvp.net/api/lol/na/v1.4/summoner/by-name/Kameros?api_key=2472734e-3298-44d5-b026-b21e290f7959

This returns: {"kameros":{"id":25175759,"name":"Kameros","profileIconId":7,"summonerLevel":30,"revisionDate":1457149807000}}


Our request limit is 10 requests per 10 seconds,
and 500 requests per 10 mins.

App Start:
——————————————
Enter League username, or continue as anonymous.

(Should people log in with password? Or is it good enough that
 they just enter their league account name)

League Username Entered:
——————————————
 - View Match History
 - View Current game?
 - View Champion mastery?
 - View Current Ranked League? (View your current league, like gold5 or whatever)


Postable Builds:
———————————————
 - Anonymous Viewers can view posted builds
 - Users that enter their League username can post builds

 - Weekly Free Champion Rotation:
	- https://na.api.pvp.net/api/lol/na/v1.2/champion/266?api_key=2472734e-3298-44d5-b026-b21e290f7959
	- Returns: {"id" 266,"active":true,"botEnabled":false,"freeToPlay":true,"botMmEnabled":false,"rankedPlayEnabled":true}
	
	- Instead of the above query, you can do: https://na.api.pvp.net/api/lol/na/v1.2/champion?api_key=2472734e-3298-44d5-b026-b21e290f7959
	- And it will return all of the free champions, instead of just the one by id you entered.
